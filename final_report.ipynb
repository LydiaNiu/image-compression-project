    "After compressing images using k-means clustering, we will turn compression into a prediction problem. We are using k-means clustering to compress images, measure how much quality is lost, and then use a supervised model (KNN) to predict which images belong to a certain category.\n",

    "Since images vary in how compressible they are, can we measure and predict compression quality?\n",
