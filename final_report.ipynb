    "After compressing images using k-means clustering, we will turn compression into a prediction problem. We are using k-means clustering to compress images, measure how much quality is lost, and then use a supervised model (KNN) to predict which images belong to a certain category.\n",

    "Since images vary in how compressible they are, can we measure and predict compression quality?\n",

    "As evident by the compressed images, the colors are approximated using K-Means method and then stored into clusters based on their similarity.

This means that the larger the defined K value is, the closer the produced image will be to the original image. \n",

    "In terms of the error, portraits have the lowest average MSE at 276.53 and a low overall SSIM of 0.7857. This indicates an overall low compression quality for this category of image. While the numerical change between a pixel's color value is low (MSE), the low SSIM means that the structural information of the entire image is poor. A possible explanation for these values would be the smoothness of the subjects' skin, subtle lighting with tonal gradients, and blurred backgrounds. All of these factors contribute to making a complex image that is difficult for the colors to be approximated and put into clusters.\n",

    "On the other hand, Still Life images have the highest average SSIM at 0.8464, and an average MSE of 305.19. This indicates that it has the best preservation of quality after the compression algorithm is run. An explanation for this high performance is from the nature of Still Life images as a whole, where objects are well defined and have relatively smooth surfaces, making color clustering an effective method to use for compression."

    "Going back to our hypothesis and cross referencing it to our matrix of results for each category, we can conclude that compression performance is indeed worse for images with higher edge density and color diversity when the k value is low. Architecture and Urban images exhibit high average MSE at k=4 (452 and 453 respectively), and low SSIM (0.796 and 0.729 respectively). This combination indicates a low compression performance due to there being an insufficient amount of clusters to accomodate the high variety of colors, ultimately resulting in a major loss in quality after compression is applied."
